## PERSONAL EVALUATION
This was more rough than I expected. It felt like the class went from 0 to 100 in a day. Through the assistance from my co-worker and TA's I was able to find an efficient route. An actual route that works. HTML and CSS was completely a different experience. It was more based on creativity, JavaScript although requires some creativity. I believe it's more based on functionality. I'm definitely going to need to keep working on other assignments to keep me prepared for the real world scenario.
